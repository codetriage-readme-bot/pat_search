# PATENT SEMANTIC SEARCH 

This is a trivial use case of the capabilities of the [semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). This web application parses RDF data in n-triples format and asserts various relationships between the graph of data. It tries to potray the effectiveness of using SPARQL queries to retrieve content information.
